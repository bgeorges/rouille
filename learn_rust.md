Recommended to get started with Rust
----
* The best place to start learning Rust is to head to the [official doc page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* And [here](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks) where a larger collection of ressources is being maintained / updated.


Embedded Rust

* [Bob](https://github.com/bobmcwhirter) pointed me [here](https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust) for embedded Rust ressources, which includes books and many other essential materials in one single page 
* If you own a Raspberry Pi, [here](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) is a good place to start
